# Exoskeleton

For countless long nights, you have toiled away in your underground bunker building your magnum opus. Those fools laughed at you once, but WHO'S LAUGHING NOW? MWAHAHAHAHAAAAA!!!

Now, there is one final thing your creation needs before you unleash it on an unsuspecting world. It needs... a website.

Exoskeleton is a simple, responsive mad science boilerplate to kickstart any responsive mad science project.

Check out <http://getskeleton.com> for documentation and details.

## Getting started

Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/sdukhovni/exoskeleton`

### What's in the repo?

The repo includes Exoskeleton's CSS, Normalize CSS as a reset, a sample favicon, and an index.html as a starting point.

```
exoskeleton/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   ├── normalize.css
│   └── skeleton.css
└── images/
    └── favicon.ico

```

### Why it's awesome

Exoskeleton is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive grid. Nothing more.
- Around 400 lines of CSS unminified and with comments
- It's a starting point, not a UI framework
- No compiling or installing...just vanilla CSS


## Browser support

- Chrome latest
- Firefox latest
- Opera latest
- Safari latest
- IE latest

The above list is non-exhaustive. Exoskeleton works perfectly with almost all older versions of the browsers above, though IE certainly has large degradation prior to IE9.
